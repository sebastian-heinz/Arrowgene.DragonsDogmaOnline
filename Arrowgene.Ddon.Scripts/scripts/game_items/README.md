# Game Items

This module handles the implementation of items which requires the server to be involved.

- When creating a new `game_item`, create a `csx` file which matches the name of the item.
-  If an item has many settings or complex settings, create a new settings file for the item
   under `settings/game_items`, named the same as the `Item.csx`
