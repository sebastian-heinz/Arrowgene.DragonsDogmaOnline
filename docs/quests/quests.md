## What works in the current implementation

- Currently only [Season 1.0 MSQ](#season-10), [Season 1.1 MSQ](#season-11) and a limited number of [World Quests](#world-quests) are activated.
- Quest rewards can be claimed from the reward box after completing a quest.

> [!WARNING]
> The quest system generally doesn't work well in parties with multiple players. The world quests will reward all players in the party, but only the party leader will get quest banners as the quest progresses and completes.

> [!WARNING]
> Quest progress is only saved when a quest is completed. If you do some intermediate steps, then disconnect or log out, you will need to repeat all steps from the start.

> [!WARNING]
> Adjusted quest homepoint during battle events is not implemented yet. If you homepoint, you may need to log out and restart the quest.

> [!NOTE]
> If a quest completes in a safe area, the party leader needs to exit the area and reenter to restart the quest.

> [!NOTE]
> The server currently treats every completion of the quest as the first time.

> [!NOTE]
> The dialouge from NPCs for the quest is probably incorrect but I can't read the messages they say to correct them :)

## Main Story Quests

There exists an implementation of the following main story quests.

### Season 1.0

| Quest Name | Comment |
|:----------:|:-------:|
| [Resolutions and Omens](http://ddon.wikidot.com/mq:resolutionsandomens) | Some issues related to NPC FSM when transitioning between groups in the first area. Gear flickers for a moment after completing the quest.
| [The Slumbering God](http://ddon.wikidot.com/mq:theslumberinggod) | Working Well.
| [Envoy of Reconciliation](http://ddon.wikidot.com/mq:envoyofreconciliation) | Working Well.
| [Soldiers of the Rift](https://ddonline.tumblr.com/post/126992462344/mq-soldier-of-the-rift) | Working Well.
| [A Servants Pledge](https://ddonline.tumblr.com/post/127075717759/mq-a-servants-pledge) | Mostly working well. Quest at end a little weird because we have pawns already. Pawn Dungeon needs more mob placement.
| [The Crimson Crystal](https://ddonline.tumblr.com/post/127290993039/mq-the-crimson-crystal) | Working Well.
| [The Dull Grey Ark](https://ddonline.tumblr.com/post/128250949024/wq-the-dull-grey-ark) | Working Well
| [The Girl in the Forest](https://ddonline.tumblr.com/post/128253902059/mq-the-girl-in-the-forest) | Working mostly well. Boss fight all monsters need to die, not just troll.
| [The Goblin King](https://ddonline.tumblr.com/post/128255137129/mq-the-goblin-king) | Working Well.
| [The House of Steam](https://ddonline.tumblr.com/post/128376072499/mq-the-house-of-steam) | Working Well.
| [The Assailed Fort](https://ddonline.tumblr.com/post/128754598369/mq-the-assailed-fort) | Playable. Some orcs missing at start. Front gate of gritten has two entrances. Needs NPC state machines added.
| [The Castle of Dusk](https://ddonline.tumblr.com/post/128917708449/mq-the-castle-of-dusk) | Mostly works. Unable to trigger cutscene on door enter for the boss. When boss lockout occurs, there are 2 doors in the location.
| [The Gods Awakening](https://ddonline.tumblr.com/post/128920334189/mq-the-gods-awakening) | Working well.

### Season 1.1

| Quest Name | Comment |
|:----------:|:-------:|
| [The Girl Clad in Darkness](https://ddonline.tumblr.com/post/131221518489/mq-the-girl-clad-in-darkness) | Mayleaf still present in shopping district when should not be. Skips step where player needs to complete a world quest in Mysree Grove.
| [The Stolen Heart](https://ddonline.tumblr.com/post/131318384484/mq-the-stolen-heart)  | Key gimick not working exactly as original. One of the quest markers spawns in a different place than in video (was it moved in a patch?).
| [The Roars of A Thousand](https://ddonline.tumblr.com/post/131415639659/mq-the-roars-of-a-thousand) | Some monsters spawn with less than max health. Seems to be related to the fact low level monsters are being replaced with very high level monsters. Need to teleport after the battle completed.
| [Return to Yore](https://ddonline.tumblr.com/post/132128346939/mq-return-to-yore) | Needs some better mob placement in a few places.
| [A Friendly Visit](https://ddonline.tumblr.com/post/132718212509/mq-a-friends-visit) | Unable to figure out how to mark World Manage OMs as quest objective.
| [The Course of Life](https://ddonline.tumblr.com/post/132719715094/mq-the-course-of-life) | Working well.

### Season 1.2

| Quest Name | Comment |
|:----------:|:-------:|
| [A Brief Respite](https://ddonline.tumblr.com/post/136167664409/mq-a-brief-respite) | Works well.
| [The Ark, Once More](https://ddonline.tumblr.com/post/136513169984/mq-the-ark-once-more) | Unable to use OM which forces player to end of the dungeon because unable to detect player reached end. Works well otherwise. Can't find spawning node for 1 meat monster.
| [Thinking of A Friend](https://ddonline.tumblr.com/post/137011945944/mq-thinking-of-a-friend) | Works mostly well. There is a waypoint system from WDT to Zoma. This is hard to enforce with players already having many points unlocked. Moved quest update point to area master lounge to account for it.
| [The Beast’s Final Moments](https://ddonline.tumblr.com/post/137802732454/mq-the-beasts-final-moments) | Works well. Some monsters in dungeon scaled to the previous Ark mission.
| [The Entrusted Future](http://ddon.wikidot.com/mq:theentrustedfuture) | Works mostly well. Didn't implement Leo following the player around. Some mobs need better placement.
| [The Quandary of Soldiers](http://ddon.wikidot.com/mq:thequandaryofsoldiers) | Quest works but dungeon monster placement is severly lacking. Can't find some nodes in ddon-tools for some of the meat monsters.
| [The Dwellers of the Golden Land](http://ddon.wikidot.com/mq:thedwellersofthegoldenland) | Not sure if all area locks are in place.
| [The Golden Key](http://ddon.wikidot.com/mq:thegoldenkey) | Works mostly well. Door in boss room can be opened twice during the fight, but stays locked.
| [The Great Alchemist](http://ddon.wikidot.com/mq:thegreatalchemist) | Some quirks with the lighting. Also, having hard time to get proper spawn point for second boss.
| [Be Forevermore, White Dragon](http://ddon.wikidot.com/mq:beforevermorewhitedragon) | Some weird flashing with the dragon. Seems cutscene uses it's own model instead of the one from the world manage quest.
