== Disclaimer
The project is intended for educational purpose only.

== Developer Setup

. Clone the repository
.. `git clone https://github.com/sebastian-heinz/Arrowgene.DragonsDogmaOnline.git`
. Install .NET 9.0 SDK or later https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
. Use your IDE of choice
.. *Visual Studio*
... Open the `DragonsDogmaOnline.sln`-file
... Note: Minimum version of "Visual Studio 2022" or later.
.. *VS Code*
... Download IDE: https://code.visualstudio.com/download  
... C# Plugin: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp  
... Open the Project Folder: `\Arrowgene.DragonsDogmaOnline`
.. *IntelliJ Rider*
... https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/
... Note: Minimum version of "IntelliJ Rider 2021.3" or later.
... Open the `DragonsDogmaOnline.sln`-file
. Debug the Project
.. Run the `Ddon.Cli`-Project with arguments `server start`

== Deployment

The application (server) requires the (ASP).NET runtime 9 to function. Alternatively the SDK also works and is required when building from source.

On a high level, a total of four components are required to successfully connect a client:

. Web server
. Login server
. Game server
. Database

All of these components are provided & automatically started up in the default developer setup outlined above.

As the developer setup relies on an embedded https://www.sqlite.org/index.html[SQLite] database, this might not suite all production needs (e.g. the embedded SQLite setup currently lacks ARM binaries). Thus, two more relational databases are supported:

. https://mariadb.org/[MariaDB]
. https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL]

=== Container setup

It is also possible to run a containerized setup.
A xref:./Dockerfile[Dockerfile] is provided which encapsulates everything required to build & publish the server from source. Three separate docker-compose files are provided depending on the desired database. None of these actually reference any image and instead rely on ad-hoc source code builds as the image is currently not publicly available.

. xref:./docker-compose.yml[SQLite-enabled docker-compose]
.. `docker-compose up`
. xref:./docker-compose.mariadb.yml[MariaDB-enabled docker-compose]
.. `docker-compose -f docker-compose.mariadb.yml up`
. xref:./docker-compose.psql.yml[PostgreSQL-enabled docker-compose]
.. `docker-compose -f docker-compose.psql.yml up`

==== Useful run commands

* Force rebuild `docker-compose up --build`
* Clean up & delete persistent volumes (data) as well `docker-compose down -v`
* Only build the image `docker-compose build`
* Build for other runtimes, e.g. arm64 `RUNTIME=linux-arm64 docker-compose build`
* All-in-one clean & rebuild `docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up --build`
* All-in-one clean & rebuild & arm64 `RUNTIME=linux-arm64 docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up --build`

== Server
With default configuration the server will listen on following ports:

[source]
----
52099 - http/download
52000 - tcp/gameserver
52100 - tcp/loginserver
----

ensure that no other local services listen on these ports.

== Client
Launch the client with the following args:

`"DDO.exe" "addr=localhost port=52100 token=00000000000000000000 DL=http://127.0.0.1:52099/win/ LVer=03.04.003.20181115.0 RVer=3040008"`

== Guidelines
=== Git 
==== Workflow
The work on this project should happen via `feature-branches`
   
Feature branches (or sometimes called topic branches) are used to develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release. 
When starting development of a feature, the target release in which this feature will be incorporated may well be unknown at that point. 
The essence of a feature branch is that it exists as long as the feature is in development, 
but will eventually be merged back into develop (to definitely add the new feature to the upcoming release) or discarded (in case of a disappointing experiment).

1. Create a new `feature/feature-name` or `fix/bug-fix-name` branch from master
2. Push all your changes to that branch
3. Create a Pull Request to merge that branch into `master`

=== Best Practise
- Do not use Console.WriteLine etc., use the specially designed logger.
- Own the Code: extract solutions, discard libraries.
- Annotate functions with documentation comments (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/documentation-comments).
